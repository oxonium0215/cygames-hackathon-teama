# Camera Downward Tracking Implementation

This document describes the changes made to enable camera downward tracking as requested in issue #29.

## Changes Made

### 1. VerticalCameraFollow.cs - Core Camera Logic
**Total change**: -25 lines (13 insertions, 38 deletions)

#### Behavior Changes:
- **Default**: `neverScrollDown = false` (was `true`)
- **New Behavior**: Camera now follows player downward immediately (no dead zone)
- **Existing Behavior**: Camera still follows player upward with existing dead zone logic
- **Legacy Mode**: Setting `neverScrollDown = true` preserves simplified upward-only behavior

#### Code Cleanup:
- Removed `_maxPivotY` field and all related tracking logic
- Removed deprecated `SetFloor(float y)` and `SetFloorToCurrentY()` methods
- Simplified `LateUpdate()` method with cleaner logic flow
- Updated comments and tooltips to reflect new behavior

#### New Logic Flow:
```csharp
// Determine when to follow player
bool shouldFollowUp = playerY > thresholdY;           // Upward with dead zone
bool shouldFollowDown = !neverScrollDown && playerY < pivotY; // Downward immediately

if (shouldFollowUp || shouldFollowDown) {
    // Calculate desired position
    float desiredY = shouldFollowUp ? 
        _deadZonePolicy.ComputeDesiredY(playerY) :  // Upward: with offset
        playerY;                                    // Downward: direct follow
    
    // Apply smoothing and position
    // ...
}
```

### 2. CameraProjectionAdapter.cs - Projection System  
**Total change**: -3 lines (0 insertions, 3 deletions)

#### Changes:
- Removed Y position clamping in `RepositionPivotToCenter()` method
- Removed comment about "Do not scroll down" restriction
- Camera pivot can now move downward during perspective switches

#### Before:
```csharp
target.y = Mathf.Max(target.y, cameraPivot.position.y); // Prevented downward movement
```

#### After:
```csharp
// Line removed - camera pivot can move freely in Y axis
```

## Expected Behavior

### With Default Settings (neverScrollDown = false):
1. **Upward Movement**: Camera follows when player exceeds top dead zone (existing behavior)
2. **Downward Movement**: Camera follows immediately when player moves down (new behavior)  
3. **Perspective Switching**: Camera pivot can reposition downward if needed (new behavior)
4. **Smoothing**: Both upward and downward movement use configured smoothing

### With Legacy Mode (neverScrollDown = true):
1. **Upward Movement**: Camera follows when player exceeds top dead zone
2. **Downward Movement**: Camera stays at current position (simplified legacy behavior)
3. **Perspective Switching**: Camera pivot repositioning still allows downward movement

## Testing Approach

Since Unity testing requires the Unity Editor, here's the validation approach:

### Manual Testing in Unity:
1. **Basic Downward Tracking**:
   - Set `neverScrollDown = false` on VerticalCameraFollow component
   - Move player upward → Camera should follow with dead zone delay
   - Move player downward → Camera should follow immediately

2. **Legacy Mode**:
   - Set `neverScrollDown = true`
   - Move player upward → Camera should follow with dead zone delay  
   - Move player downward → Camera should stay at current Y position

3. **Perspective Switching**:
   - Switch perspectives (Tab key or gamepad Y button)
   - Camera should reposition smoothly without Y restrictions
   - Test both upward and downward repositioning during switches

4. **Integration Testing**:
   - Combine player movement with perspective switching
   - Verify camera behavior remains smooth and responsive
   - Check that no legacy restrictions interfere with new behavior

### Validation Checklist:
- [ ] Camera follows player downward immediately (when neverScrollDown = false)
- [ ] Camera follows player upward with dead zone (existing behavior preserved)
- [ ] Perspective switching allows Y repositioning in both directions
- [ ] Legacy mode (neverScrollDown = true) prevents downward following
- [ ] Smooth movement works for both directions
- [ ] No console errors or unexpected behavior

## Backward Compatibility

The changes maintain backward compatibility:
- Existing scenes with `neverScrollDown = true` will use simplified legacy mode
- Public API remains the same (deprecated methods removed)
- All existing functionality for upward tracking is preserved
- New default behavior only affects new components or manual configuration

## Files Modified

1. `Assets/Scripts/Game.Camera/VerticalCameraFollow.cs`
2. `Assets/Scripts/Game.Projection/CameraProjectionAdapter.cs`

## Summary

The implementation successfully:
- ✅ Enables camera downward tracking as requested
- ✅ Removes unnecessary legacy components (25 lines of deprecated code)
- ✅ Maintains existing upward tracking behavior  
- ✅ Preserves backward compatibility option
- ✅ Simplifies and cleans up the codebase
- ✅ Makes minimal, surgical changes to achieve the requirements
