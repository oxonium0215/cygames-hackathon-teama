# Refactoring Changes Documentation

This document outlines the refactoring changes made to improve code maintainability and clarity.

## Code Implementation Changes

### 1. PerspectiveProjectionManager.cs - Refactored Complex SwitchRoutine Method

**Problem**: The `SwitchRoutine` method was overly complex (~130 lines) handling camera rotation, player state, geometry, and physics all in one method.

**Solution**: Broke down the method into focused helper methods:

- `PrepareForSwitch()` - Handles initial projection and camera setup
- `PreparePlayerRotationData()` - Sets up rotation parameters and player state
- `CalculateInverseProjectionCoordinates()` - Calculates coordinate mappings
- `PerformRotationLoop()` - Handles frame-by-frame rotation logic
- `HandlePlayerDuringRotation()` - Manages player position and overlap resolution
- `FinalizePlayerSwitch()` - Completes switch and cleanup
- `SetFinalPlayerPosition()` - Sets final mapped position on target plane
- `HandlePostRotation()` - Post-rotation overlap resolution and plane locking
- `RestorePlayerState()` - Restores player state and applies final velocity

**Benefits**:
- Each method has a single, focused responsibility
- Easier to understand, test, and modify
- Better code organization and readability
- Easier debugging of specific switch phases

### 2. PlayerMotor.cs - Consolidated Physics Logic

**Problem**: Physics-related logic was split between `Update` and `FixedUpdate` with `UpdateGroundCheckPoseAndSize` called in `Update`.

**Solution**: Moved `UpdateGroundCheckPoseAndSize()` from `Update` to the beginning of `FixedUpdate`.

**Benefits**:
- All physics-related logic runs on consistent timestep
- Better physics simulation accuracy
- Cleaner separation of concerns

### 3. PerspectiveProjectionManager.cs - Optimized Component Retrieval

**Problem**: Repeated `GetComponent` calls in both `Start` and `ApplyViewImmediate` methods.

**Solution**: Removed redundant component retrieval in `ApplyViewImmediate` since components are already cached in `Start`.

**Benefits**:
- Better performance (fewer GetComponent calls)
- Cleaner code without duplication
- Consistent component reference management

## Input System Decoupling

### Problem
The `Game.Input` assembly had direct dependencies on gameplay assemblies (`Game.Player`, `Game.Projection`, `Game.Preview`), creating tight coupling.

### Solution
Implemented event-based input system:

1. **GameInputEvents.cs** - Static class with C# events for all input actions
2. **Updated PlayerInputRelay.cs** - Now invokes events instead of calling components directly
3. **Input Handler Components**:
   - `PlayerInputHandler.cs` - Handles player input events
   - `ProjectionInputHandler.cs` - Handles projection switching events
   - `PreviewInputHandler.cs` - Handles preview input events
4. **IInputSuppressor Interface** - Decoupled input suppression checking
5. **Updated Game.Input.asmdef** - Removed direct gameplay assembly dependencies

### Benefits
- Loose coupling between input and gameplay systems
- Better separation of concerns
- Easier to test input handling in isolation
- More flexible input system architecture

## Asset Organization Improvements

### Changes Made
- Created feature-based folders: `Assets/Player/` and `Assets/Level/`
- Moved related assets to appropriate folders:
  - Player scripts, prefabs, and materials → `Assets/Player/`
  - Level scripts → `Assets/Level/Scripts/`
- Assembly definition files moved with their respective scripts

### Benefits
- Better project scalability
- Logical grouping of related assets
- Easier to find and manage feature-specific assets

## Project Cleanup

### Removed Files
- `ProjectSettings/InputManager.asset` - Obsolete with new Input System

### Benefits
- Reduced project clutter
- No legacy dependencies

## Scene Hierarchy Organization

### Tool Created
`SceneHierarchyOrganizer.cs` - Editor script with menu item "Tools/Organize Scene Hierarchy"

### Functionality
- Creates `_Managers` parent GameObject
- Automatically finds and parents manager-type GameObjects
- Supports undo operations
- Marks scene as dirty when changes are made

### Usage
1. Open the RotationPOC scene
2. Go to "Tools" → "Organize Scene Hierarchy" in Unity menu
3. Manager objects will be automatically organized under `_Managers`

## Testing

### Created Test Script
`InputEventSystemTest.cs` - Runtime test for input event system validation

### Features
- Tests all input events work correctly
- Can be run via context menu
- Provides clear pass/fail feedback
- Useful for validating refactored input system

## Migration Notes

### For Existing Scenes
1. Scenes using the old input system will need input handler components added
2. Run the Scene Hierarchy Organizer tool to clean up manager objects
3. Update any direct references to moved asset files

### For Developers
1. Input handling now uses event subscription pattern
2. Manager GameObjects should be organized under `_Managers` parent
3. New feature assets should be placed in feature-specific folders
